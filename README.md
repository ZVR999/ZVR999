- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZVR999
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, R, reading financial charts, and trading financial instruments.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R for building web apps, console apps, trading algorithms, and visualizing data coming from the markets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on trading algorithms for employments. My main skillset is the ability to understand why the finanical markets move the way they do. 
  I will be adding a strong coding skillset to this to add more value to my career skillset. Currently, I'm able to read and understand code, but until now; I haven't had any good 
  reasons to build my coding skills.
