- 👋 Hi, I’m Zach
- 👀 I've solidified my foundations with Python, reading financial charts, and trading/investing in financial instruments and am now interested in breaking into Cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently involved in a cyber security bootcamp with Springboard while also being enrolled in Offensive Security courses, working with my home lab, and courses with TryHackMe.
- 💞️ I’m looking to get my start in cybersecurity to then constantly learn and do more within this field.
