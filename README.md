- 👋 Hi, I’m Zach

- 👀 I've solidified my foundations with coding, reading financial charts, and more for my current employment as a quant trader and am now interested in breaking into Cybersecurity.

- 🌱 I’ve graduated from the cybersecurity bootcamp with Springboard and currently, I'm enrolled in Offensive Security courses, working with my home lab, and courses with TryHackMe, and Pentester Academy.

- 💞️ Since I love to constantly learn and do more, the field of cybersecurity defintely feels right for me!
